You save time by not having to hunt for the changes
You get to see all the changes between the files so know that are looking at the point where errors can occur
you get to see what's added and removed as either may cause issues

Reflect:Using History for Efficiency
You get to see all changes as they occurred in the order they occurred
You can trace the problem easier if you know when it occurred

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
They create a process that suits the type of content they intend to be managed

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
get the id's of the diffs using the git log and apply those id's to the git diff command

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You get an easy way to revert changes back to the original working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Version control some files
